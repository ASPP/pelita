Dependencies

Pelita requires pyzmq, PyYAML, and numpy.


Standard team layout
====================

When writing a team, it is useful to follow a standard module layout::

    team/
         __init__.py
         my_player.py
         utils/
               __init__.py
         test/
              __init__.py


Inside `team/__init__.py` players are required to define a function `factory`::

    def factory():
        return SimpleTeam("My team name", Player(), Player())


    def Player(AbstractPlayer):

        def set_initial():
            pass

        def get_move():
            pass

Please have a look at the methods in `AbstractPlayer` as to be sure what better not to override in the subclass (or only with calls to `super()`).
Note, however, that you are free to use `__init__` when instantiating your class.
That means that you can easily add parameters to your classes.
