"""Continuous Integration Engine.

Currently this module is only usable as a script, later it shall be
extended to be used as a library for a web service providing a
continuous integration service.

In its current form it is still very usable to test a couple of agents
automatically against each other and compare the results. For best
results modify the ``agents`` section in the ``ci.cfg`` configuration
file and run this file. Leave it running for a while until the positions
stabilized.
