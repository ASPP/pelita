    Parameters
    ----------
    team_specs : list[team0, team1]
              a list specifying the two teams to play the match with. The list
              items team0 and team1 must be either
               - a function with signature move(bot, state) -> (x, y)
                 The function takes a bot object and a state and returns the next
                 position (x, y) of the bot.

               - the path to a Python module that defines at least a function
                 called 'move' (specified as above) and a string TEAM_NAME.

              When a team_spec is a function, a "local" game will be run, when
              they are paths to Python modules, a "remote" game will be run instead.
              See below in section Notes for more details about local and remote games.

    layout_dict : dict
               a dictionary representing a maze, as returned by pelita.layout.parse_layout

    max_rounds : int
              The maximum number of rounds to play before the game is over. Default: 300.

    rng : random.Random | int | None
        random number generator or a seed used to initialize a new one.

    error_limit : int
                   The limit of non fatal errors to reach for a team before the
                   game is over and the team is disqualified. Non fatal errors are
                   timeouts and returning an illegal move. Fatal errors are raising
                   Exceptions. An error_limit of 0 will disable the limit.
                   Default: 5.

    timeout_length : int or float
                  Time in seconds to wait for the move function (or for the remote
                  client) to return. After timeout_length seconds are elapsed a
                  non-fatal error is recorded for the team.

    initial_timeout_length : int or float
            Time in seconds to wait for a remote player to have started

    viewers : list[viewer1, viewer2, ...]
           List of viewers to attach to the game. Implemented viewers: 'ascii',
           'progress', tk'. If None, no viewer is attached.

    store_output : False or str
                if store_output is a string it will be interpreted as a path to a
                directory where to store stdout and stderr for the client processes.
                It helps in debugging issues with the clients.
                In the special case of store_output==subprocess.DEVNULL, stdout of
                the remote clients will be suppressed.

    team_names : tuple(team_name_0, team_name_1)
              a tuple containing the team names. If not given, names will be taken
              from the team module TEAM_NAME variable or from the function name.

    team_info : tuple(team_info_0, team_info_1)
              a tuple containing additional team info.

    raise_bot_exceptions : bool
                    when True, allow teams to raise Exceptions. This is especially
                    useful when running local games, where you typically want to
                    see Exceptions do debug them. When running remote games,
                    raise_bot_exceptions should be False, so that the game can collect
                    the exceptions and cleanly create a game-over state if
                    needed.

    print_result : bool
                when True (default), print the result of the match on the command line

    Notes
    -----

    - remote games
        If teams_specs is a list of two Python modules, a "remote" game will be
        played. This means that the game will create one client subprocess for
        each module. The game communicates with the clients using the local network
        and sends/receives messages in JSON format. The game master will ask for the
        next position of a bot over the network, the clients will call their move
        function to get the next position and will return the position over the
        network. This setup allows for complete isolation of the clients, i.e. they
        can not see or influence each other directly.

    - local games
        If team_specs is a list of two functions, a "local" game will be played. This
        means that the game will get the next position of a bot by calling the
        corresponding move function directly. This mode is particularly useful to play
        many games in the background without a UI, because it skips all the network
        overhead of the remote games.
