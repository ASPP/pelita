""" simplesetup.py defines the SimpleServer and SimpleClient classes
which allow for easy game setup via zmq sockets.

Notes / TODO

Timeout handling was far more elegant (imho) with actors / futures.
Back then, timeouts were reply-based which meant that no other incoming
messages would change the timeouts of other messages.

Now it is all sockets so that each incoming message will reset the timeout
and we need to manually handle this.

A proper solution would use quick-and-dirty queues with size one.
(Which would also allow us to store the received messages.)

In 2.7, thread queues are too slow for that. (Asymptotically they only
check every 50ms for new messages which accumulates quickly in our scheme.)

Gevent queues are fast but do not like zeromq (there is a hack, though);
in a future version we might want to revisit this decision. At the time
we switch to Python 3.2+, if thread queues might have become fast enough
(or maybe if the gevent interface likes our messaging layer), we should
re-investigate this decision.
