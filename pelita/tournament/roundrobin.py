    # We want to optimise the matchplan in multiple ways:
    # a) At any point each team should have a similar number of played games
    # b) No team should play two games directly after another;
    # both of these points should make the tournament more interesting to
    # follow.
    # Finally, in the interest of fairness:
    # c) Blue and red teams (ie. who starts the match) should be assigned evenly.
    #
    # For an even number of teams (> 4), these points can be fulfilled with the
    # circle method; for an odd number of teams, however, it should be noted
    # that the circle method is not the most optimal algorithm. [1]
    #
    # As having five teams is the usual case during ASPP student tournaments,
    # we will special-case this one and implement the circle method in all
    # other cases. (Arguably, round-robin tournaments with more than 6 teams
    # will tend to become rather lengthy and should probably be executed
    # differently anyway.)
