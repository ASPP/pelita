    Notes
    -----
    - Move functions:
        A move function is a function with signature move(bot, state) -> (x, y).
        The function takes a bot object and a state and returns the next position of
        the current bot as a tuple (x, y). `state` is initially an empty dictionary.

    - Timeouts:
        As opposed to standard pelita matches, timeouts are not considered.
