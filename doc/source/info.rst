Acknowledgements
================

The game is inspired by the `“Pac-Man Projects”
<http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/project_overview.html>`_  developed
by John DeNero and Dan Klein at Berkeley University for their artificial intelligence
introductory course [DeNeroKlein]_.

This software was developed for the “Advanced Scientific Programming in Python”
summer school, as a teaching aid for the group project.
