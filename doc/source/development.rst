Project-Wall
============

We used an agile project wall to track tasks for the initial stages of the
development. In our case we split it into four distinct sections: ``todo``
(upper right), ``current iteration`` (upper left), ``done`` (lower left) and
``nice to have`` (lower right). Since we only had one whiteboard we kept the
center for sketches and doodles.  You can read about the agile project wall in
the book: `The Agile Samurai
