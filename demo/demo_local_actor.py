"""
This is a more verbose demonstration, which describes how to play a game
using local actors.

In general, the simplesetup methods should be sufficient.

Note: When a game runs, the ServerActor gives all control to
the game_master, so it is not possible to query (or stop)
the actor anymore until the game has finished.
